# Roadmap

This is a living list of future work.

## Short term

- Harden all public-facing services (TLS policies, headers, rate limits).
- Add more automated tests for compose files and configs.
- Expand troubleshooting docs for VPN, DNS, and pfSense.

## Medium term

- Add more dashboards (Grafana) and logging (Loki or similar).
- Integrate hardware monitoring for home node and storage.
- Add optional object storage tier at home for cold backups.

## Long term

- Package PCEP as a repeatable “appliance” for other users.
- Add MDM / PXE-based device provisioning flows.
- Support additional edge locations (work node, cabin, etc.).
