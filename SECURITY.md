# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This is a personal project and does not have formal support windows.
Security fixes are applied on a best-effort basis as issues are
discovered and reported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue in:

- Any of the Docker Compose services,
- The documented pfSense, VPN, DNS, or backup configuration,
- GitHub Actions or automation scripts,

please report it privately first.

### How to report

- Email: `security@your-domain` (replace with your actual address).
- Do not open a public GitHub issue for sensitive vulnerabilities.

Include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Affected component (compose file, script, config, etc.).
- Any ideas you have for mitigation or a fix.

## Expectations

- I will acknowledge your report as soon as practical.
- I may request more information or logs.
- Once a fix is ready, I will decide when and how to document the issue
  publicly.

Do not test against systems you do not own or control. Do not use findings
from this project to attack anyone’s infrastructure.
