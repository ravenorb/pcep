# Code of Conduct

This project is intended to be a practical, technical space. We still
expect everyone to behave like adults and treat each other with respect.

## Expectations

- Be constructive and direct, not hostile.
- Attack problems, not people.
- Assume good intent where possible.
- Keep discussions technical and on-topic.

## Unacceptable behavior

Examples of behavior that are not welcome:

- Harassment, threats, or personal attacks.
- Hate speech or discriminatory language.
- Deliberate intimidation or stalking.
- Sharing others’ private information without consent.
- Repeated, bad-faith disruption of discussions.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior in project spaces:

- Email: `security@your-domain` (replace with your actual address), or
- Open a private issue if you are comfortable doing so.

Provide as much context as you can. Reports will be handled as discreetly
as possible.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they consider appropriate, including:

- Warnings.
- Editing or removing comments.
- Temporary or permanent bans from contributing.

Decisions are final. This is not a democracy; it is a maintained project.

If you cannot operate under these rules, do not participate.
